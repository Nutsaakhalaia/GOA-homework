        <b><i>Ice hockey originated in Canada in the mid-19th century. While the exact origins are debated, the modern version of the sport is based on European field hockey and a variety of games played on ice in Canada, particularly in the province of Ontario.
        <br> The first recorded indoor ice hockey game took place in Montreal in 1875, where teams played with a flat rubber puck.
        <br> The National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in 1917 in Canada and originally had just 4 teams.
        <br> Ice hockey is often called “the fastest game on ice” due to its incredibly fast pace and intense physical play.
